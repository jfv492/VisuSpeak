    Parameters
    ----------
    model: str
        choose which pre-trained Keras deep learning model to use for the 'bottom' layers of the custom model
    model_weights_path: str
        optional path to weights for classification block; otherwise, pre-trained weights will be loaded
    top_model: bool
        whether to include custom classification block, or to load model 'without top' to extract features
    color_mode: str
        whether the image is gray scale or RGB; this will determine number of channels of model input layer
