# User Testing Plan

## Phase 1: Testing UI/UX and AI Model

**Objective:** Evaluate the UI/UX design and assess the performance and accuracy of the AI model.

**Participants:** Saskatchewan Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services (SDHHS) Team, Jasmine Owens (Accessibility Officer - U of R Accessibility Centre)

**Methods:**
- Think-aloud testing: Participants verbalize their thoughts and actions as they interact with the UI/UX and AI features.
- Task-based testing: Participants perform specific tasks to evaluate the ease of navigation and interaction.
- Surveys/questionnaires: Collect feedback on user satisfaction, ease of use, and any issues encountered.

**Metrics:**
- Task success rate: Measure the percentage of tasks completed successfully.
- Time on task: Assess the time taken by participants to complete tasks.
- Error rate: Track the frequency and nature of errors encountered during testing.
- User satisfaction: Gather subjective feedback on the overall experience.
- Developer Comments: Analyze user interactions to identify areas of interest and potential pain points.

## Phase 2: Testing Chat Functionality

**Objective:** Evaluate the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the chat functionality integrated with the AI model.

**Participants:** SDHHS, U of R Accessibility Centre, ASL Students(U of R)

**Methods:**
- Scenario-based testing: Present participants with typical chat scenarios to assess how well the system responds.
- Error handling testing: Intentionally introduce errors to observe how the chat functionality and integrated AI model handle them.
- Natural language understanding (NLU) testing: Evaluate the accuracy of the chat understanding of user inputs.

**Metrics:**
- Response accuracy: Measure the correctness of responses provided.
- User engagement: Assess the level of interaction and retention during chat sessions.
- Error recovery rate: Evaluate the chat's ability to recover from errors and guide users back on track.
- Developer Comments: Analyze user interactions to identify potential pain points.

## Phase 3: Testing the Entire Application

**Objective:** Validate the overall functionality, integration, and user experience of the entire application.

**Participants:** Saskatchewan Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services (SDHHS), Jasmine Owens (Accessibility Officer - U of R Accessibility Centre), ASL Students(U of R)

**Methods:**
- End-to-end testing: Simulate real-world user journeys covering all features and functionalities.
- Usability testing: Assess the ease of use and intuitiveness of the application as a whole.
- Compatibility testing: Test the application across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes.
- Performance testing: Evaluate the application's responsiveness and loading times under various conditions.

**Metrics:**
- Overall satisfaction: Gather feedback on the overall experience and likelihood of continued usage.
- Completion rate: Measure the percentage of participants who successfully complete key tasks.
- Developer Comments: Document and prioritize any bugs or issues encountered during testing for resolution.
