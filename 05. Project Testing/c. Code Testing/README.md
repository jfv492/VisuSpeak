# Testing Plan 

## Introduction 
The purpose of this testing plan is to develop different testing techniques for different components of the project.
## Objectives
- Ensure that the software meets the functional requirements
- Validate the performance, usuability, and security aspects of the software
- Ensure compatbility with different devices, browsers, and operating systems
## Scope 
- Front-end: User Interface 
- Back-end: Data management
- AI Model: Hand gesture recognition algorithm
## Testing Approaches
- Front-end Testing:
    - Component testing using Jest to ensure individual components function correctly.
    - Regression testing to detect any unintended errors on existing features.
    - Error handling tests to validate application responsiveness and stability.
- Back-end Testing: 
    - Jest to validate functionality and reliability.
    - Error handling tests to monitor API requests and responses through console.
- AI Model Testing:
    - Performance evaluation to measure execution time and resource usage.
## Test Schedule
 The testing will be done between January 2024 - March 2024
## Risks and Mitigation 
- Develop comprehensive test cases covering all functionalities.
- Conduct thorough compatibility testing across multiple devices and browsers.
