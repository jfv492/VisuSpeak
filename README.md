## 🎯 Project Idea 
Our team aims to create an innovative ASL-English bidirectional translation application for the capstone project. This application will aim to bridge the communication gap between ASL users and English speakers. This application will enable seamless real-time translation from ASL to English, allowing people with special accessibility needs to communicate effectively with others and gain access to essential services and information.

## ⚙️ Project Background
Many people with special needs, particularly those with vocal and hearing impairments, rely on American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary mode of communication. However, there is frequently a significant communication gap between ASL users and those who speak or understand English primarily. This gap can lead to misunderstandings, limited opportunities, and exclusion for ASL users in various areas, such as education, employment, healthcare, and social interactions.

Our proposed project will enhance accessibility for individuals with vocal and hearing impairments by providing a reliable tool for communicating with English-speaking individuals, thereby reducing communication barriers and fostering inclusion. This application can facilitate communication between ASL Users and English speakers in educational settings.
